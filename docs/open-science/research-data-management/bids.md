# BIDS 

If you are following the project workflow, by now you should have a project set up on the cluster and you might be in the process of organizing your **raw data**. The next step is to convert your data into BIDS format.

[**BIDS**](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_started.html) is an acronym that stands for **Brain Imaging Data Structure**. It is a standardized format to organize and describe neuroscientific data (see the schema below).</b>  
In a nutshell, BIDS provides a framework for standardizing file names, folder structures and metadata for different kinds of data such as neuroimaging, behavioral, physiological etc.  
We recommend you to go through the [BIDS Starter Kit pages](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/) to understand more in depth the concepts and the phylosophy behind BIDS.

## Why BIDS?

- It provides a logical and intelligible structure for data of different kinds.
- It makes your data clear and reusable by other researchers, thus increasing the chance of collaborations and the chance of being cited.
- It helps you to organize your data without coming up by yourself with an efficient and flexible structure.
- It has been adopted by all the major tools for neuroscientific analysis.
- It improves science and also your science. 
  
## How to BIDS 

In the following tabs, we explain how to convert your data into BIDS for different modalities. We focused only on specific tools that are either widely used or provide some advantages for the users.
If any issue occurs, or you have a request for a specific tool that we do not cover here, please contact emanuele.porcu at ovgu.de.

    ### Using heudiconv to convert fMRI data to BIDS

    [Heudiconv](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a python library which helps you to convert f/MRI data to BIDS with little effort. You do not need to be very proficient in python to use it. YOu can either follow this brief tutorial or use the [tutorials](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) provided by the heudiconv developers and users.

    **Step 1**
    
    In order to convert correctly your data, heudiconv leverages on so called heuristics.</b>     
    Heuristics are rules that you provide to the software to specify which files you would like to convert.
    
    You must specify such rules within a python script that is then passed to heudiconv. You do not need to create this script from scratch, you can generate a template by running the following line on the terminal:

    ```bash
    $ heudiconv --files your_dicom_file -o bids_output_dir -f convertall -s number_of_the_subject -c none
    ```

    The previous command does **not** convert any of your data, but it creates, within the output directory, a hidden folder, `.heudiconv`, containing a template of the script `heuristic.py` and a `dicominfo.tsv` which lists all the information about the dicom files necessary for specifing the heuristics. 
    
    
    !!! note "Check your dicoms"
        It is a good practice to extract your dicom files and check by yourself the file names to assess that they match with the names stored by heudiconv in the `dicominfo.tsv`.


    !!! Danger "Delete .heudiconv" 
        Before running the actual BIDS convertion, make sure to delete the **.heudiconv** directory, otherwise the conversion will not produce a correct BIDS dataset.

    **Step 2**
    
    The following example represents a `heuristic.py` script taylored for a specific dataset. You can also use this template and adapt it to your own dataset.


    ```python

    from __future__ import annotations

    import logging
    from typing import Optional

    from heudiconv.utils import SeqInfo

    lgr = logging.getLogger("heudiconv")


    def create_key(
        template: Optional[str],
        outtype: tuple[str, ...] = ("nii.gz",),
        annotation_classes: None = None,
    ) -> tuple[str, tuple[str, ...], None]:
        """
        This function allows you to create
        the keys necessary to extract the files
        that you want to convert.
        """

        if template is None or not template:
            raise ValueError("Template must be a valid format string")
        return (template, outtype, annotation_classes)


    def infotodict(
        seqinfo: list[SeqInfo],
    ) -> dict[tuple[str, tuple[str, ...], None], list[str]]:
        """Heuristic evaluator for determining which runs belong where

        allowed template fields - follow python string module:

        # Create keys: This section is specific to each project

        fmap = create_key("sub-{subject}/fmap/sub-{subject}_fieldmap")
        epi = create_key("sub-{subject}/fmap/sub-{subject}_epi")

        # the dictionary info must contain your keys
        info: dict[tuple[str, tuple[str, ...], None], list[str]] = {

            # the core of the heuristics. 
            # Modify them according to the dicom file names and 
            # other features (like data size) that 
            # can help select the correct files

            if "t1_mpr" in s.protocol_name:
                info[t1w].append(s.series_id)
            elif 'fMRI_SMS2_2.2iso_66sl_TR2_run' in s.protocol_name and s.dim4 == 200:
                info[task].append(s.series_id)
            elif 'field_mapping' in s.protocol_name:
                info[fmap].append(s.series_id)
            elif 'EPI' in s.protocol_name:
                info[epi].append(s.series_id)
            
        return info
    ```
    
    The essential parts of the script that you need to modify are the **keys** and the actual **heuristics**:

    - **Keys:** In the `dicominfo.tsv` (you can find it in `.heudiconv`) file you find the exact naming of the dicom files, you need to go through the list of files and decide which of them are important for your analysis. Once you have made your decision, you can create the proper keys by following the naming conventions explained in the [BIDS tutorial](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/folders_and_files/files.html). The keys create the BIDS compliant file names and the structure.
    
        Assume you have a T1 weighted image, you need to create a proper key for it:

        ```python
        t1w = create_key("sub-{subject}/anat/sub-{subject}_t1w")
        ```
        Note that we have specified the subject folder `sub-{subject}/` where `{subject}` is a placeholder that heudiconv fills in with the correct subject ID. We have specified the folder `anat/` dedicated to all the anatomical images and we have specified `tw1` which is the standard name for T1 weighted images. Keep in mind that you might have have different anatomical images, please refer to the BIDS main website.   

        Let's create another key for the bold images, one per run:

        ```python
        task = create_key("sub-{subject}/func/sub-{subject}_task-foodchoice_run-{item:01d}_bold")
        ```

        In this example it is important to notice that we follow the same pattern as for the T1 weighted image, but this time we have specify the folder `func`, which as you should know, stands for **functional**. Additionally we have specified the task name
        `task-taskname`, the runs, `_run-` and the `bold` suffix that indicates the type of functional file we are dealing with.

        We need to create as many keys as the number of types of files we want to include in our BIDS convertion.

    - **Heuristics:** Now we need to create a few basic rules to tell heudiconv which files to extract.
    
        In the following example we simply match the name of a `dicom` we would like to include in the BIDS conversion with the file names contained in `s.protocol_name`, if there is a match we add the file in the `info` dictionary.

        ```python
        if "t1_mpr" in s.protocol_name: # name matching
            info[t1w].append(s.series_id) # append to the dictionary
        ```
        Sometimes a file name matching is not enough to extract a the correct file, so we can combine more rules like the following one, in which we match the file name and the file size.

        ```python
        elif 'fMRI_SMS2_2.2iso_66sl_TR2_run' in s.protocol_name and s.dim4 == 200:
            info[task].append(s.series_id)
        ```

        As you might guess you need to create rules on a case by case basis.


    **Step 3**

    Now you just need to run heudiconv for the actual conversion with the following line, please for further information about heudiconv specs visit the software page or type `heudiconv --help` in the terminal:
    

    ```bash
    $ heudiconv --files <file_containing_dicoms> -o <directory_for_bids/> -f <heuristic.py> -s <subject_number> -c dcm2niix -b --overwrite
    ```

    Note that heudiconv creates the whole BIDS structure, the sidecars as `.json` files, and the events files as `.tsv`.</b>   `events.tsv` are just tabular files containing the header: `onset	duration	trial_type	response_time	stim_file`. Your task is to complete these files according to the bids conventions.

=== "EEG/MEG"

    ### EEG BIDS recommended formats

    Given the variety of EEG data formats, BIDS recommends two main formats (we also strongly suggest to use these two formats):

    1. European format: `.edf`
    2. BrainVision format: `.vhdr, .vmrk, .eeg`

    Other BIDS accepted formats, although not recommended, are:

    3. Biosemi: `.bdf`
    4. EEGLAB: `.fdt .set`

    ### EEG conversion with Fieldtrip (Matlab)



    ### EEG conversion with MNE (python)

=== "Behavioral/Physiological"

    ### Behavioral data

    BIDS for behavioral data follows conventions similar to those used for the `events.tsv` files with neural recordings. 
    We recommend to read carefully the [description](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/behavioral-experiments.html#behavioral-experiments-with-no-neural-recordings) provided in the BIDS website.

    !!! note "Behavioral data general rules"

          - **What kind of data:** Any behavioral measures (with no concurrent neural recordings).
          - **File types:** Tabular data as `.tsv` with the following header `trial response response_time stim_file` (further entries can be added please refer to the BIDS page above). Metadata as `.json` files.  
          - **Where:** Data must go under the `<beh>/` folder.
          - **How:** Data must have the following format:</b>  
                          `<matches>_beh.tsv`</b>  
                          `<matches>_beh.json`</b>  
                      where `<matches>` can be `sub-012_task-mytaskname`. In case you have multiple sessions and runs your file might be:`sub-012_ses-1_task-mytaskname_run-1-beh.tsv` and  the relative metadata `sub-012_ses-1_task-mytaskname_run-1-beh.json`.
    
    
    !!! note "Save your behavioral data already in BIDS" 
        It is convenient to save your raw behavioral files as BIDS compliant. 
    
    Given the large variety of structures and formats that researchers use for their behavioral experiments, we do not provide an example.

    ### Physiological data

    We recommend to read the [dedicated page](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/physiological-and-other-continuous-recordings.html) in the BIDS website. 

    !!! note "Physio data general rules"

        - **What kind of data:** Cardiac, respiratory and other continuous recordings
        - **File types:** Continuous recordings as compressed files `.tsv.gz` (no header). Metadata as `.json` files.  
        - **Where:** Data can go under different `<datatype>/` folders, such as `func`, `anat`, `dwi`, `meg`, `eeg`, `ieeg`, or `beh`
        - **How:** Data must have the following format:</b>  
                        `<matches>[_recording-<label>]_physio.tsv.gz`
                        `<matches>[_recording-<label>]_physio.json`
                    where `<matches>` can be `sub-012_task-mytaskname` and `_recoding-<label>` can be used to distinguish between two or more type of recording e.g. `recording-breathing` and `recording-eyetracking`. In case you have multiple sessions and runs your file might be: `sub-012_ses-1_task-mytaskname_run-1-breathing_physio.tsv.gz` and the relative metadata `sub-012_ses-1_task-mytaskname_run-1-breathing_physio.json`.

## Data Version Control

One of the most important aspects of data management is to keep track of the evolution of your data. This task might be particularly error prone if done manually, it is, thus, advisable to use a systematic and automated approach.</b>  
As for software development also data can be tracked via **version control**. There are not many version control tools dedicated to data, the main one is [Datalad](https://www.datalad.org/), which in the last years has been heavily adopted in cognitive neuroscience research.</b>   
Datalad does not simply track the changes of your data, but also records their relationships. Beyond that, the datalad ecosystem includes other tools that can help you to make your science reproducible and collaborative.


The best way to start with Datalad is to go through the [Datala-handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/).
Dalalad is natively used through the command line, like [git](https://git-scm.com/), but for those who are less comfortable with the terminal there is also a [**GUI version**](http://docs.datalad.org/projects/gooey/en/latest/).
